# BOJ-2024

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Baekjoon Online Judge (BOJ)](https://www.acmicpc.net/). I aim to solve one problem each day and upload the code here.

## Structure

- Each solution is organized by the week of 2024 it was solved.
- The file names correspond to the problem number for easy reference.
